### 🎉 CRITICAL BUG FIX - GetObject Consistency Issue Resolved (November 2, 2025)

**Bug Description**: GetObject was using inconsistent `bucketPath` construction compared to PutObject/ListObjects/DeleteObject, causing 404 errors even though objects were successfully uploaded.

**Root Cause**: Lines 726-734 in `pkg/s3compat/handler.go` had complex logic with `shareTenantID` and `allowedByPresignedURL` that could alter the bucketPath differently than other operations.

**Fix Applied**: Simplified GetObject bucketPath logic to always use `h.getBucketPath(r, bucketName)` when no share is active, ensuring consistency with all other S3 operations.

**Impact**:
- ✅ GetObject now works correctly for all authenticated requests
- ✅ Presigned URLs now work properly (were failing due to same bug)
- ✅ Veeam and other backup tools should now work correctly
- ✅ All S3 operations now use consistent bucket path resolution

**Testing Completed**:
- ✅ Basic operations: PUT, GET, LIST, DELETE with versioning
- ✅ Multiple versions of same object
- ✅ DELETE markers (soft delete)
- ✅ Permanent DELETE of specific versions
- ✅ Version restoration
- ✅ ACLs and public access
- ✅ Multipart upload (40MB in 2 parts)
- ✅ Presigned URLs for temporary access
- ✅ Object copy between buckets
- ✅ Range requests (partial downloads)
- ✅ Object tagging
- ✅ Object Lock & Retention (GOVERNANCE mode)
- ✅ Legal Hold
- ✅ Lifecycle policies (GET operations)
- ✅ CORS configuration (GET operations)
- ✅ Bucket policies (GET operations)
